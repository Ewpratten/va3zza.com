title: The History of RetryLife
---

> RetryLife was a music and video production collective run by a group of friends.


I founded RetryLife with an elementary school friend and began producing music under the name. As time progressed, we brought on two more core artists, and a handful of guest artists to assist in content creation. At our peak, we were producing regular albums, weekly YouTube music videos, vlog-style video content, and various pieces of web content. We also produced many full orchestral peices and a [full theatrical soundtrack](https://retrylife.bandcamp.com/album/imagined) for [Lester B. Pearson School for the Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson_School_for_the_Arts).

It is through my work under RetryLife that I developed many of my software development, visual art, musical, and group management skills.

**The RetryLife project came to an end in 2017 when the group had to part ways due to school.**
