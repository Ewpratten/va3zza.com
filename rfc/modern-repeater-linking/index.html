    <h1>RFC: A fast system for repeater linking using modern web technology</h1>
    
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
        <p>The three common standards for amateur radio repeater linking are all built on old and cumbersome technology. In the world of repeater linking, the most predominant standards for interconnection are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://secure.echolink.org/">Echolink</a>
<ul>
<li>Closed-source</li>
<li>Strict governance</li>
<li>A strong lack of APIs</li>
<li>Does not allow cross-system linking
<ul>
<li>ex: cannot link Echolink conferences to Allstar nodes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://allstarlink.org/">AllStarLink</a>
<ul>
<li>Absolute overkill</li>
<li>Most node configurations require special hardware to set up</li>
<li>Built on the Asterisk PBX</li>
<li>Uses phone networks to link repeaters</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="http://www.irlp.net/">IRLP</a>
<ul>
<li>Requires specialized hardware</li>
<li>Uses old connection standards</li>
<li>Closed-source</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In my ideal world, there would be a small, lightweight, and configurable linking backend that developers could extend in any way they wished. This proposal is not the end-all-be-all solution, but a step in the direction of this vision.</p>
<h2 id="node-discovery">Node discovery</h2>
<p>In a linking system like Echolink, <em>all</em> clients announce themselves to a central directory server. This server then decides if a client is &quot;worthy&quot; (verified license, not banned from the service, ...) then lists the client on <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://secure.echolink.org/logins.jsp">a somewhat parsable webpage</a>. The topology for such a setup is as follows:</p>
<div class="mermaid">
flowchart LR
    You(You) --- D1((Directory Server))
    D1 --- NA(Node A) & NB(Node B) & P1(Proxy) & ND(Node D)
    P1 --- NC(Node C)
</div>
<p>In most cases, this works just fine. However, there are two off the top of my head that raise an issue:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Node A</code> and <code>Node B</code> are owned by a club that wants to keep the nodes private for member use only.</li>
<li><code>Node C</code> is behind a restrictive firewall, or does not want to expose a host to the public internet.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second of the two scenarios is solved already in the above graph using a proxy. Echolink proxies have become extremely common due to the fact very few people have access to a network where their host can be exposed publicly for other nodes to directly connect to when making a link.</p>
<p>Echolink's solution to the first issue is fairly lacking in my opinion. Nodes only have the option to restrict connections based on a REGEX on their callsign. This means maintaining a list of allowed users, and updating <em>every</em> club-owned node when that changes.</p>
<h3 id="decentralizing-directory-services">Decentralizing directory services</h3>
<p>While I like Echolink a lot, I think some improvements could be made to both the node directory system, and how nodes link to each other. Ideally, I see a setup as follows:</p>
<div class="mermaid">
flowchart TD
    D1((Directory A))
    D1 --- NA(Node A) & NB(Node B) & NC(Node C)
    D2((Directory B))
    D2 --- NC & ND(Node D)
    D3((Private Directory))
    D3 --- NE(Node E) & NF(Node F)
    NE --> D2
</div>
<p>In this world, anyone could host a directory server, and either open it up to the public, or restrict it by means of their choosing (callsign rules, password, key-based access, ...). Nodes can then connect to one or many directories of their choosing. This could allow situations where a node could sit on the edge between two private intranets and have access to other nodes on <em>both</em> sides of the boundary without requiring either side to expose some part of itself to the public internet.</p>
<h3 id="routing">Routing</h3>
<p>I also envision a routing system where nodes attached to more than one directory service would periodically propagate information about their first-hop directories to other first-hop directories. An example of such interaction from the perspective of <code>Node C</code> would be:</p>
<pre data-lang="text" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-text "><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span>Node C -&gt; Directory A: You can find Directory B at &lt;address&gt;
</span><span>Node C -&gt; Directory B: You can find Directory A at &lt;address&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p><code>Node E</code> would have a different interaction. Since <code>Private Directory</code> is <em>private</em>, its announcement would <em>exclude</em> that directory:</p>
<pre data-lang="text" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-text "><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span>Node E -&gt; Private Directory: You can find Directory B at &lt;address&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>At this point, the directory servers should then be able to directly query eachother about their &quot;routing tables&quot;. Over time, each directory server would build a list of which directory servers it can reach for information about nodes.</p>
<p>The rable for <code>Private Directory</code> would look like this:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Server</th><th>Address</th><th>Hops</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Directory B</td><td><code>&lt;address&gt;</code></td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Directory A</td><td><code>&lt;address&gt;</code></td><td>2</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>If <code>Node F</code> were to try connecting to <code>Node A</code>, the order of messages would be:</p>
<pre data-lang="text" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-text "><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span>Node F -&gt; Private Directory: Do you know Node A?
</span><span>
</span><span># Private Directory queries the first table entry
</span><span>Private Directory -&gt; Directory B: Do you know Node A?
</span><span>Directory B -&gt; Private Directory: No
</span><span>
</span><span># Private Directory queries the second table entry
</span><span>Private Directory -&gt; Directory A: Do you know Node A?
</span><span>Directory A -&gt; Private Directory: Node A is at &lt;address&gt;
</span><span>
</span><span># Node F is informed of the address of Node A
</span><span>Private Directory -&gt; Node F: Node A is at &lt;address&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Of course, since <code>Node F</code> is <em>only</em> connected to a <em>private</em> directory service, if <code>Node A</code> were to try connecting to <code>Node F</code>, the order of messages would be:</p>
<pre data-lang="text" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-text "><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span>Node A -&gt; Directory A: Do you know Node F?
</span><span>
</span><span># Directory A queries the first table entry
</span><span>Directory A -&gt; Directory B: Do you know Node F?
</span><span>Directory B -&gt; Directory A: No
</span><span>
</span><span># Directory A was never informed that Private Directory exists, since it is private
</span><span># Thus, there is no route to Node F
</span><span>Directory A -&gt; Node A: No
</span></code></pre>
<p>Like every other piece of amateur radio backbone software, this routing system relies on trust. I am not an expert in identity verification, and I will not attempt to devise a system for stopping bad actors from poisoning the routing tables in this document.</p>
<h2 id="audio-transport-using-modern-tech">Audio transport using modern tech</h2>
<p>So far in this document, node addresses have been used extensively, yet nodes are not expected to expose any ports to the internet. In the real-world, it has become very common to see peer-to-peer real-time media links in the form of video conferencing services. These services largely rely on WebRTC, a standardized, strong, and reliable protocol for peer-to-peer content streams.</p>
<p>While WebRTC still struggles to deliver perfect quality audio and video simultaneously, it is more than capable of <em>just</em> streaming audio, with the added benefit that basically every browser supports it natively. Most programming languages also have one or many strong WebRTC libraries to work with.</p>
<p>This means that a full implementation of this document would result in something similar to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Directory server
<ul>
<li>Handles incoming clients</li>
<li>Handles routing tables</li>
<li>Handles access rules</li>
<li>Performs client lookups when requested</li>
<li>Possibly provides telemetry information</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Client library
<ul>
<li>Establishes connections with one or more directories</li>
<li>Periodically propagates information about connected directories</li>
<li>Can request to create or destroy a link</li>
<li>When a link is created, it exposes a direct WebRTC connection to the remote node</li>
<li>Hands off responsibility for the connection to whatever software wraps the library</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The wrapping software could be one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A website</li>
<li>A smartphone app</li>
<li>A headless application running on a Raspberry Pi that connects straight to a radio for a simplex node</li>
<li>An application running on a repeater controller</li>
<li>Anything else</li>
</ul>
