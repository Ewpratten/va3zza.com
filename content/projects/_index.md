## Embedded

I enjoy working with embedded systems, especially those that allow me bare access to the hardware. Pictured below are the Atmel chips I commonly work with; on the left, the [ATmega328P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATmega328), and on the right, my favourite microprocessor: the [ATmega32u4](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/ATMEGA32U4).

In the past, I have written small kernels for both of these chips to back various other projects, and as a way to teach myself the ins and outs of embedded kernel development.

## The archives

The following list contains additional completed projects that I no longer maintain and that did not make it into a section above.
