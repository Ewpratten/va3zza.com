# Software development

I spend a significant amount of time developing software. I have written a number of applications, libraries, and tools. 99% of which are open-source.

## Contributing to the Rust ecosystem

I see a strong future for the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) programming language, and have made it my primary language over the past year.

I would love to write Rust code professionally, but until I get the opportunity, I am dedicating my time to providing many crates and tools to the Rust ecosystem. Due to this effort, a large portion of my projects are written in Rust.

## Notable projects

- [PolyMesh](https://github.com/Ewpratten/polymesh)
  - An experimental file format for expressing 3D scenes in parts
- [git2codeblock](https://github.com/Ewpratten/git2codeblock)
  - Turn GitHub and GitLab codesnippet URLs into Markdown codeblocks
- [rfclib](https://github.com/Ewpratten/rfclib)
  - A library for querying IETF RFCs
