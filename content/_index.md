    <h1>Hi, I'm Evan Pratten!</h1>
    <p>
        I'm a Canadian software developer, 3D artist, photographer, musician, <a href="/blog">blogger</a>, amateur radio operator, and general <a href="/projects">maker of things</a>.
        <br><br>
        I love to experiment with little-used technologies, and specialize in <em>making things interconnect</em>.

## What am I up to?

As always, I'm working on multiple projects at the same time and have my head crammed full of technobabble. Currently, I am:

- Working on the graphics pipeline powering children's TV productions at [Industrial Brothers](https://www.industrialbrothers.com/)
- Administering experimental internet routing gear
- Contributing to the Rust library and tooling ecosystem over on [GitHub](https://github.com/ewpratten)
