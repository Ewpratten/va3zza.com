## About me

I am a first-year college student, studying Information Security at Sheridan College, starting this fall. I develop software both as a hobby, and professionally, and have been programming since I was in the 5th grade. I am also a Canadian amateur radio operator (callsign **VA3ZZA**), and the former Lead Software Developer at [Raider Robotics](https://github.com/frc5024).
