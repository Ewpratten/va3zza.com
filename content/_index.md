## About me

<span class="description">I'm a Canadian software developer, 3D artist, photographer, musician, [blogger](/blog), amateur radio operator, and general maker of things. I love to experiment with little-used technologies, and specialize in *making things interconnect*.</span>

<!-- I am a first-year college student, studying Software Engineering at Sheridan College. I develop software both as a hobby, and professionally, and have been programming since I was in the 5th grade. I am also a Canadian amateur radio operator (callsign **VA3ZZA**), and the former Lead Software Developer at [Raider Robotics](https://github.com/frc5024). -->


As always, I'm working on multiple projects at the same time and have my head crammed full of technobabble. Currently, I am:

- Working on the graphics pipeline powering children's TV productions at [Industrial Brothers](https://www.industrialbrothers.com/)
- Administering experimental internet routing gear
- Contributing to the Rust library and tooling ecosystem over on [GitHub](https://github.com/ewpratten)
- Working with low-power radio communication modes

## Am I on air?

...given how little time I leave for hobbies some days, probably not. But it's worth a check anyways. If I happen to be reaching you with my transmissions, please QSL.

## I make music too!

Every once in a while, I get around to uploading a new track or two. If you'd like to hear my musical experiments, check out my profiles on:
