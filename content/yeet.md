*So uhh I've linked this page in too many places to track now.. Hello from wherever you came from :wave:*

**VB3YEET** is a special event callsign for *Meme Appreciation Month*. This callsign will be in use along with a handful of others as a part of an event organized by our dearest leader [VA4BEN](https://www.qrz.com/db/VA4BEN) during the period between *June 25th 2022* and *August 5th 2022*.

## The goal

I think each of us have slightly different goals with our meme calls. Mine is to make radio contacts in any way possible with whoever wants to participate. No restrictions on location or time, and I'll gladly accept multiple QSOs from the same person in the same band. Why not fill up a logbook with a single station? :man_shrugging:

## Contacting VB3YEET

I (VA3ZZA) will be the primary operator of VB3YEET, although I may allow some other friends to use the call for a few days (possibly during times when I'm at work?).

There is very little in the way of a plan for which bands, frequencies, and modes will be in use. Please refer to the following data for real-time information about callsign usage:
